# non-private-ip

check if you have a non-private ip address

more info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network

Your laptop probably does not have a non-local ip address,
but your vps server probably does. This just returns the first
address, which will probably be IPv4.

this module is just a simple wrapper for [ip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ip)
