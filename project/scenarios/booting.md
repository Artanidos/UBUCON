# Booting
The first node is starting and creates an anonymous account automatically.  

(Now this node is listening to broadcasts on a specific port.)

The user can edit the profile and can already post a feed which will be broadcasted into the void and also stored in the local cache database.

The database is used like a blockchain. No records are being altered. Newer versions of a specific feed will be appended to the blockchain. Older records (blocks) from the beginning will be dropped, after X days.

# Invitation
Node A is now going to connect to someone else. Therefore an invitation link will be generated which can be send to a friend.  
This link consists of a uuid and an expiration date.

# Second Node
A second node will also start up.
The user can now paste in the invitation link and starts to broadcast a request to the net.
