## Phase I 
This phase shall just mint THX on a daily base for the user.
The user should open the app once a day to start minting, that keeps the user focusing on the app and motivates to invite more people to mint even more THX.
It should also be there to invite other people to the circle.

When we reach a circle of 1.000.000 members we will start phase II.
## Phase II
In phase II we will start to develop the app with the following features.
- Paying between two mobile phones should be possible.
- Chatting p2p will be possible.
- Micro blogging shall be possible.
- Maybe crowdfunding is needed before, we will see if we can motivate developers.
- Also developers can be payed out with THX or a mixture of THX and EUR.

## Phase III
Plugins will be supported.
- Traffic Light for houses
